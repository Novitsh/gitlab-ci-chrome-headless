# GitLab CI - Chrome headless

This project allows you to work with GitLab CI and use a container that can both 
git push to an origin and allow you to run a headless chrome.

This is useful when you have another external git repository hosting your codebase of
your application and at the same time you are in need of headless browser capabilities
for purposes such as Behat testing.
